"""
In this example, the DataView class inherits from Django's View class, and overrides the get() method to handle incoming GET requests. 
It opens a connection to the MySQL database and continuously reads data from the socket. When one second of data has been received, 
it calculates the average, inserts that average into the database, clear the data list and reset the start time. 
and prepare the data to send to the browser as json format and return it by JsonResponse.

You will have to create the url pattern in urls.py file to map the URL to this view and also you have to design a template 
to display the graph by using javascript library like chart.js or d3.js

It's important to note that this is just an example and is not guaranteed to work perfectly as is, you may need to adjust it 
to fit your specific requirements.
