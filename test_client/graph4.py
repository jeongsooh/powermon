"""
In this example, the first app has a DataView class that inherits from Django REST framework's APIView class and overrides 
the get() method to handle incoming GET requests. It opens a connection to the MySQL database and continuously reads data 
from the socket. When 15 minutes of data has been received, it calculates the average, inserts that average into the database, 
clear the data list and reset the start time and current_minutes, and prepare the data to send as json format.

The second app uses the requests library to make a GET request to the first app's endpoint, it will get the json_data as response 
and ready to process it.

It's important to note that this is just an example and is not guaranteed to work perfectly as is, you may need to adjust it 
to fit your specific requirements and also make sure that the first app is running and the URL is correct.
